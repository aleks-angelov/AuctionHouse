##### Task:
Develop a software package to manage an auction house’s catalogue of items for sale.

##### Description:
The items-for-sale catalogue should comprise a number of categories, e.g. pottery; art; stamp collections; coin collections; bric-a-brac; etc., with items for auction placed in the appropriate categories by the system administrator. Each item should have a description of what it is, a valuation and a photo.

Customers may browse the list of items for sale – he/she does not have to be registered. But only registered customers can bid on items posted for sale. There must be a facility for a customer to make a bid for an item. The current best bid for an item will be displayed.

The software should provide a new user registration facility – personal details, including credit card details to be entered into the system and saved. A userid and password are to be included. The software must advise if the userid is already in use. These details must be recorded in a database.

Only an administrator may post items for sale. There must be a facility for a customer to inform the administrator of an item for sale.
